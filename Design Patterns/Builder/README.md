# Builder Design Pattern


When Contruction gets a little bit too complicated.

- Some objects are easy to create in a single initialization call. But few get complex.
- Having >10 initializer arguements is not productive. We should opt for piecewise contruction.

> Builder provides an API for constructing an object step by step.

## Builder: When piecewise object construction is complicated, Builder provides an API for doing it in a brief and clearly expressed  manner.
