# Single Responsiblity Principle

-  A class with Single Responsiblity
-  A single reson to change
-  SRP states: If a class has any persistance then remove if from the class and write a seperate class for the same which again most importantly follows Single Responsiblity.
-  Key Term: Seperation of Concerns
-  Nicer and Maintainable Architecture.
