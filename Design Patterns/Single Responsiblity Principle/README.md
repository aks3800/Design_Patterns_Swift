# Single Responsiblity Principle

>  A class with Single Responsiblity\n
>  A single reson to change\n
>  SRP states: If a class has any persistance then remove if from the class and write a seperate class for the same which again most importantly follows Single Responsiblity.\n
>  Key Term: Seperation of Concerns\n
>  Nicer and Maintainable Architecture.\n
